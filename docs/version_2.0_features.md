# Twitter AI Agent - Version 2.0 Features

## Current System Analysis

The current Twitter AI Agent (v1.0) is a system that can autonomously browse Twitter, make posts, and interact with content based on a defined personality profile. The system uses:

- **Personality-driven decision making**: Actions are determined by a personality profile (like Kiara's)
- **Browser automation**: Uses SeleniumBase to interact with Twitter
